# Universal StickyNotes
## The original Universal Paperclips
imagine a paperclip company developing an AI by giving it the simple task of creating paperclips. It'll eventually spiral out of control leading to exponential but unethical efficiency of simply making paperclips. This is the Paperclip Dilemma. It was a thought experiment by Nick Bostrom. I decided that I want to make a 3D tycoon-esque game based off of Universal Paperclips, but instead with Sticky Notes.

## Core Loop (not in order)
* Make Sticky notes
* hire new workers
* raise and lower price of sticky notes
* study public demand
* unlock office space for more sticky note production
## Base Mechanics
* Simple 3D movement
* First person
* Euclidean panels you can click on while still being in a 3D environment
* Very simplistic models for everything, as below showcased
